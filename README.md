# yummydata

YummyData is a Python-based scraper that extracts data from Platsbanken and stores it in an SQLite database. 
It also wildly flings NLP at the data with moderate success.

The YummyData project uses the following Natural Language Processing (NLP) and related tools:

    NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): Used for tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming.
    BeautifulSoup: Used for parsing HTML and XML documents.
    NumPy: Used for numerical operations.
    Scikit-learn: Used for feature extraction (TF-IDF Vectorizer) and topic modeling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation).
    SQLite3: Used for database operations.
    Requests: Used for making HTTP requests.
